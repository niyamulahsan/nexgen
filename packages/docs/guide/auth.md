# Authentication

## Overview

Auth ships complete. A fresh project has a working user system — you protect a route and sign in; you do not build the login flow first.

| Included | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Register | `POST /api/auth/register` |
| Sign in | `POST /api/auth/login` |
| Email verification | `POST /api/auth/verify-email` |
| Forgot / reset password | `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`, `POST /api/auth/reset-password` |
| Silent refresh | `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` (and automatic in the middleware) |
| Sign out | `POST /api/auth/logout`, `POST /api/auth/logout-all` |
| Current user | `GET /api/auth/me` |
| Roles | `GET /api/auth/role`, admin only |

Three layers do the work, and it helps to know which one you are changing:

| Layer | What it owns | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Auth module** | Users, passwords, tokens, routes, seeders | `src/modules/auth/` |
| **Middleware** | The gate: authenticate a request, expose `auth` | `src/middlewares/auth-middleware.ts` |
| **Provider** | Where users and refresh tokens are read from | `src/providers/` (or the built-in default) |

You only touch the provider when you want a different user store. Everything else works as shipped — see [Replacing auth](#replacing-auth).

## Protect a route

Attach `authMiddleware` to the group, or to a single route with an array. Identical on both engines:

```ts
// src/modules/posts/routes/index.ts
import { createRouter } from "@/framework/facade.js";
import { authMiddleware } from "@/middlewares/auth-middleware.js";
import { requireRole } from "@/middlewares/role-middleware.js";

export default createRouter()
  .api(listRoute, list) // public
  .api(createRouteDef, [authMiddleware], create) // any signed-in user
  .api(adminRoute, [authMiddleware, requireRole("admin")], remove); // admin only
```

The handler reads the authenticated user from the request context:

::: code-group

```ts [Hono]
import type { Handler } from "hono";

export const create: Handler = async (c: any) => {
  const auth = c.get("auth");
  // auth.id, auth.email, auth.roleId, auth.role, ...provider fields
  return c.json({ message: `Hello ${auth.email}` });
};
```

```ts [Express]
import type { Request, Response } from "express";

export const create = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const auth = res.locals.auth;
  // auth.id, auth.email, auth.roleId, auth.role, ...provider fields
  res.json({ message: `Hello ${auth.email}` });
};
```

:::

What the request gets:

| Request | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Valid access token | `200` — handler runs with `auth` set |
| Expired access token + valid refresh token | A new access token is set as a cookie, then the handler runs |
| No valid token, or a revoked/expired refresh token | `401` — cookies are cleared, the handler never runs |
| No auth provider at all | Warning logged, `next()` runs unauthenticated — see [degraded mode](#degraded-mode) |

Order matters: `authMiddleware` before `requireRole`, because `requireRole` reads what `authMiddleware` wrote. See [Middleware](./middleware#order-matters).

## What the middleware does

```
request
  │
  ├─ access cookie present?
  │    ├─ verify JWT
  │    ├─ provider.getUserById(payload.id)
  │    ├─ provider.getAuthContext(user, payload)?   ← optional shape override
  │    └─ set auth → next()
  │
  ├─ otherwise, refresh cookie present?
  │    ├─ verify JWT
  │    ├─ provider.findRefreshToken(jti)
  │    ├─ reject if missing, revoked, or past expiresAt
  │    ├─ provider.getUserById(payload.id)
  │    ├─ mint a new access token + set the cookie
  │    └─ set auth → next()
  │
  └─ otherwise → 401, clear both cookies
```

Details worth knowing:

- Only the **access** token is re-minted on refresh. The refresh token is not rotated on every request.
- A refresh token that is past `expiresAt` is deleted through `deleteRefreshToken` (or revoked through `revokeRefreshToken`).
- If `getUserById()` returns `null` for a token that verifies, the request is treated as unauthenticated: `401` and both cookies are cleared.
- If `getAuthContext()` is implemented, its return value is what handlers receive. Without it, the middleware builds `{ ...payload, id, email, roleId, role, ...user }`.

### Degraded mode

If **no auth provider** can be resolved — the built-in module was deleted and nothing was registered — the middleware does this:

```
[auth-middleware] auth provider not available; skipping auth.
```

and calls `next()` without setting `auth`.

::: warning Not a security boundary
That fallback exists so deleting the auth module does not crash every route. It is **unauthenticated pass-through**: a protected handler still runs. If a deployment can reach this state, the handler must check for a missing `auth` itself. With a provider present, an unauthenticated request is always `401`.
:::

## Roles

Roles are authorisation, applied after authentication. The scaffold seeds two roles:

| Role | Seeded for |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` | `admin@example.com` |
| `user` | `user1@example.com` |

The seeder password is `Password@123`. Change or remove these accounts before deploying.

```ts
import { requireRole } from "@/middlewares/role-middleware.js";

.api(adminRoute, [authMiddleware, requireRole("admin")], remove)
.api(editorRoute, [authMiddleware, requireRole("admin", "editor")], update)
```

| Situation | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `auth` is missing | `401 Unauthorized` |
| `auth.role` is not in the list | `403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions` |
| `auth.role` matches | Continues to the handler |

- Comparison is **case-insensitive**: `requireRole("Admin")` matches `role: "admin"`.
- `auth.role` must be a **string**. The default provider maps the user's `role.name` to a string for you. A custom provider that returns `role: { id, name }` will not match — flatten it to a string in `getAuthContext()`.
- `requireRole()` returns a middleware function, so it can be used per route or in `group()`.
- `GET /api/auth/role` and `GET /api/auth/role/{id}` are admin-only examples of the same pattern.

To check a role inside a handler rather than rejecting the request, use the exported helper. It takes an **array** and matches the lowercased `auth.role`, so pass lowercase values:

```ts
import { hasRole } from "@/modules/auth/facade.js";

if (hasRole(auth, ["admin"])) {
  // ...
}
```

## Token system

Auth uses two JWTs, both signed with HS256 and stored in httpOnly cookies.

| | Access token | Refresh token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default lifetime | 15 minutes (`accessExpirySeconds`) | 1 hour (`refreshExpirySeconds`), 30 days with "remember me" (`refreshRememberExpirySeconds`) |
| Secret | `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` |
| Cookie | `{cookie.name}_access` | `{cookie.name}_refresh` |
| Sent by the client | Automatically, on every request | Automatically; read only when the access token fails |
| Tracked in the database | No | Yes — `refresh_tokens` by `jti` (unique JWT id) |
| Revocable | No — expires on its own | Yes — logout, logout-all, password reset |

The client never implements refresh logic. When the access token expires, the next request refreshes it transparently.

Verify a token yourself:

```ts
import { jwt } from "@/framework/facade.js";

const payload = await jwt.verifyToken(token, "access");
// null when expired, badly signed, or of the wrong type
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | — | **Required.** Signs access tokens |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | — | **Required.** Signs refresh tokens |
| `COOKIE_SECRET` | — | **Required.** Signs cookies |
| `accessExpirySeconds` | `900` (15 min) | `src/config/jwt.ts` |
| `refreshExpirySeconds` | `3600` (1 hour) | `src/config/jwt.ts` |
| `refreshRememberExpirySeconds` | `2592000` (30 days) | `src/config/jwt.ts` |
| `cookie.name` | `nexwire` | Cookie prefix — `nexwire_access`, `nexwire_refresh` in `src/config/cookie.ts` |
| `requireEmailVerification` | `false` | Blocks login until the email is verified, in `src/config/auth.ts` |

The three secrets are the only required values. Generate each one separately; never reuse a secret between access, refresh and cookie signing.

## Cookies

Every auth cookie is `httpOnly`, `sameSite: "Lax"` (`"None"` and `secure` for cross-origin), `path: "/"`:

| Cookie | Contents | Max-Age |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{cookie.name}_access` | Access JWT | `accessExpirySeconds` |
| `{cookie.name}_refresh` | Refresh JWT | `refreshExpirySeconds`, or `refreshRememberExpirySeconds` on "remember me" |

Because they are `httpOnly`, browser JavaScript cannot read them — the client authenticates by simply sending the request. See [Cookie](./support/cookie) for the facade.

## Auth module map

The module is self-contained. This is what each part is for:

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `routes/index.ts` | Public routes (register, login, forgot/reset, verify, refresh) and protected routes (`me`, logout, logout-all) |
| `routes/role.ts` | Role read routes, behind `authMiddleware` + `requireRole("admin")` |
| `controllers/` | HTTP layer: read the request, call a service, shape the response |
| `services/` | One file per action — `login.ts`, `register.ts`, `refreshtoken.ts`, `logout.ts`, … |
| `database/models/` | Drizzle `users`, `roles`, `refresh_tokens` models |
| `database/seeders/` | `admin` / `user` roles and two demo users |
| `jobs/` | Mail jobs for registration, verification and password reset |
| `helpers/auth.ts` | `getCurrentUser`, `hasRole` — exported through the facade |
| `facade.ts` | The module's public API; other modules import from here, never from controllers or services |

Routes are auto-discovered: any `src/modules/<module>/routes/*.ts` file is mounted at `/api/<module>`. Adding a route file does not require editing a registry.

## Replacing auth

The provider is a **data adapter**, not a whole auth system. It answers two questions for the middleware:

1. Who is the user with this id? (`getUserById`)
2. Is this refresh token still valid? (`findRefreshToken`)

Its contract is `AuthProvider`; the required methods are `getUserById` and `findRefreshToken`, and three more are optional. The full contract table is in [Providers → The built-in auth contract](./providers#the-built-in-auth-contract).

```ts
// src/providers/auth.ts — imported automatically at boot
import { registerAuthProvider } from "@/framework/facade.js";
import type { AuthProvider } from "@/framework/facade.js";

const authProvider: AuthProvider = {
  async getUserById(id) {
    // Any shape you like. Extra fields reach `auth.tenantId`, `auth.plan`, ...
    return { id, email: "user@example.com", tenantId: 42, plan: "pro" };
  },
  async findRefreshToken(jti) {
    return { id: 1, jti, revoked: false, expiresAt: new Date() };
  },
  async revokeRefreshToken(tokenId) {},
  async getAuthContext(user, payload) {
    // Optional — this object becomes `auth`. Keep `role` a string for requireRole().
    return { id: user.id, email: user.email, role: "user", tenantId: user.tenantId };
  },
  async getUserContact(userId) {
    // Optional — used by notify() to find an email address.
    return { email: "user@example.com", name: "User" };
  }
};

registerAuthProvider(authProvider);
```

### What the provider does and does not control

| Provider controls | The auth module still controls |
| --- | --- |
| Where users live | `POST /api/auth/login` and credential checking |
| Where refresh tokens are stored | Signing and issuing JWTs |
| The shape of `auth` | Password hashing and the register flow |
| Email/name lookup for `notify()` | Email verification and password reset |

Registering a provider **replaces** the built-in one. It does not decorate or extend it: two providers cannot both answer for the `auth` key, and the last registration wins.

### Consequences of deleting the module

Deleting `src/modules/auth` removes the routes above — including `/login`, `/register` and `/refresh-token` — plus the JWT issuance, password hashing hooks, seeders and models.

The middleware can still authenticate and refresh **existing** sessions through your provider, but nothing creates a new sign-in. A custom auth system has to provide its own token issuance before it can log anyone in.

Notifications are unaffected: the generated notification module has no foreign key to `users` and no import of `@/modules/auth`.

## Password hashing

The module uses **bcrypt** with a cost factor of 10:

```ts
import { password } from "@/framework/facade.js";

const hash = await password.hashPassword(plainPassword);
const match = await password.verifyPassword(plainPassword, hash);
```

See [Password](./support/password) for the full facade.

## Session

Guest sessions are a **separate** subsystem, not part of auth: a `nexwire_session` cookie backed by Redis, usable by guests and signed-in users alike.

```ts
const sessionId = c.get("sessionId"); // Express: res.locals.sessionId
await session.put(sessionId, "cart", items);
```

See [Session](./session) for configuration and the API.

## Database models

### users

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | int PK | auto-increment |
| `name` | varchar(255) | |
| `email` | varchar(255) | unique |
| `password` | text | bcrypt hash |
| `roleId` | int FK → roles.id | set null on delete |
| `emailVerifiedAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | |
| `updatedAt` | timestamp | |

### roles

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | int PK | auto-increment |
| `name` | varchar(255) | unique |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | |
| `updatedAt` | timestamp | |

### refresh_tokens

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | int PK | auto-increment |
| `userId` | int FK → users.id | set null on delete |
| `jti` | varchar(191) | unique, JWT id |
| `revoked` | boolean | default `false` |
| `expiresAt` | timestamp | |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | |

## Email verification

When `requireEmailVerification` is `true` in `src/config/auth.ts`:

1. Registration creates an `email_verification_tokens` record with a 24-hour expiry.
2. A `"user:verify-email"` job sends the email.
3. The user follows the link and the client calls `POST /api/auth/verify-email` with `email` + `token`.
4. `emailVerifiedAt` is set, and login is allowed.

## Forgot / reset password

1. `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` creates a `password_reset_tokens` record with a 15-minute expiry and sends the email.
2. The client calls `POST /api/auth/reset-password` with `email`, `token`, `password` and `password_confirmation`.
3. The password is updated and **all** refresh tokens are revoked, signing the user out on every device.
